NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists. \n","    NumPy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory unlike lists, so processes can access and manipulate them very efficiently.\n","    This behavior is called locality of reference in computer science. It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.\")\n","    '''\n","    print(\"Welcome to Numpy Learning .......!\")\n","    print(f\"numpy version : {np.__version__}\")\n","    \n","    #
